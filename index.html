            <li>In Programming I, We first learned the basics of code in PencilCode, we made a choose your own adventure story, and made a starry night. Then we started Java and this was a majority of the year. We also participated in the STEM challange. Lastly, we learned how to navigate and use GitHub

                I recently went to the store and I saw that apples were like 99 cents per pound and I was unsure if I should buy a pound because I dont really like apples because its so hard to bite into but it was at a cheap price so I wondered if I should get it and I finally decided pears better

                I was trying to change the background color of my html website but it wouldn't work so I tired to look at old files and I didnt come up with any solution. Right now I will try to change the placement of the line that is suppose to change the color.
            </li>
            <li>
                UPDATE: I was successful in changing the color of my website, turns out that the line used to change color is suppose to be in the body not the style.
            </li>
            <li> In the future, I do want to pursue a career in computer science, though I'm not sure exactly what careers there are. I recently discovered that there was a CS concentration at Lane, which I would have liked to take, I never really liked art or music.
